# First we define the equation
a = differentiate(f(x), x) + f(x)*r**2*sin(theta)**2 # Test of comments on the same line as string

# next we solve the equation we called a for the function f(x):
b = dsolve(a, f(x)) 

# next we define another equation called c which is the same as equation b, where we substituted theta for y
c = subs(b, theta, y) 

# definitions of two functions:
B = g(x) 
A = h(x) 

# next, we multiply all the equations together in a specific way and, then set the result to a new variable:
eq5 = ((a*B + b*A)*(r*B)) + c

# finally we return the result of our whole computation
eq5
