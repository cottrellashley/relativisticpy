I have never written a language before, this was my first time writing a simple one.

To do this I have learn and followed the wonderful YouTube tutorial by CodePulse on "Writing a simple Math Interpreter"

This is an extenssion of the code to more general calculator for any math object. 

Additionally, instead of computing the expressions, I instead convert it to the MathJson format.
