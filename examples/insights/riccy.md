To compute the Ricci tensor directly without computing the full Riemann tensor, it involves the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives. The approach focuses directly on the contraction of the Riemann tensor to produce the Ricci tensor.

The Ricci tensor $ R_{\mu \nu} $ is defined as the contraction of the Riemann tensor over its first and third indices:

$$ R_{\mu \nu} = R^\lambda_{\ \mu \lambda \nu} $$

Using the definition of the Riemann tensor in terms of the Christoffel symbols \( \Gamma^\sigma_{\mu \nu} \), the Ricci tensor components can be expressed directly as:

$$ R_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\lambda \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu \nu} - \partial_\nu \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu \lambda} + \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu \sigma} \Gamma^\sigma_{\nu \lambda} - \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu \nu} \Gamma^\sigma_{\sigma \lambda} $$

To compute $ R_{\mu \nu} $ directly:

1. Compute the Christoffel symbols for the given metric.
2. Differentiate the Christoffel symbols as indicated in the equation above.
3. Plug these derivatives, along with the original Christoffel symbols, into the equation to obtain the Ricci tensor components.

This approach bypasses the full computation of the Riemann tensor but still requires differentiation and algebraic manipulation of the Christoffel symbols.
