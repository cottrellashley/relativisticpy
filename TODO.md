## Grammar Syntax for RelPy

- **Context-Dependent Grammers:** Currectly I only have one Lexer and one Parser (Grammar) -> I would like to have the ability to trigger different lexers via contex driven letters i.e. "G^" or "G_" trigger the tensor grammar such that we decode the tensor and can use characters which are different meaning in the context of a tensor such as G_{a:[0,1,2]}_{b:0} will grab the tensor indices which the user specified and not create an array [0, 1, 2] (which is what the current grammar would interpret this as and break.)
