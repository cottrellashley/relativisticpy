Parser Module:

- Parses strings into python dict/lists representation of the Abstract Syntax Tree.
- Workbook module will traverse the tree, injecting the methods which handle relevant operations / computation / object descerialization / etc...

TODO: CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF COVERTTING THE WHOLE MODULE TO C AND NOT PYTHON. STILL QUITE A BIT TO GO, BUT GETTING THERE!!
