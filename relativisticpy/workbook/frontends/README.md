RelativisticPy's main goal is it's ease of use. In order to be easy to use, we want to do most of the object initialization work.

This module is here to do just that, deserializer strings into RelativisticPy python objects which can then be used to compute the quantities the user wants.

Basically, anything to do with:

String Input -----> Relevant RelativisticPy Object

Will go in here.

The only exception is the sympify module, since it is a big feature of its own and brings in a dependency from JsonMathPy library.
