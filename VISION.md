The vision of this project is to provide a very easy to use, modularised low complex code which provides users with a tool to solve General Relativity (GR) Python equations, especially for those new to the field.:

### Additional Objects in General Relativity to Implement
1. **Kerr Metric**: A solution of the Einstein field equations that describes the spacetime geometry in the region surrounding a rotating mass. Essential for understanding rotating black holes.
2. **Schwarzschild Metric**: Describes spacetime around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating mass. Fundamental for understanding black holes and gravitational time dilation.
3. **Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Metric**: Used in cosmology, it describes a homogeneous, isotropic expanding or contracting universe.
4. **Penrose-Carter Diagrams**: Useful for visualizing and understanding the causal structure of spacetime, especially around black holes.
5. **ADM Formalism**: Decomposes spacetime into space and time, useful in numerical relativity.
6. **Penrose Process**: Describes energy extraction from a rotating black hole, which is an interesting aspect of black hole thermodynamics.
7. **Hawking Radiation**: Code modules to model or simulate this quantum effect could be intriguing.

### Famous Solutions to Implement
1. **Kerr-Newman Solution**: For charged, rotating black holes.
2. **Reissner-Nordström Solution**: For charged, non-rotating black holes.
3. **Oppenheimer-Snyder Model**: Describes gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric body and formation of black holes.
4. **Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi Models**: Solutions for dust-filled universe models, useful in cosmology.

### New Manipulations or Features
1. **Tensor Visualization Tools**: Implement ways to visually represent tensors, perhaps in a 3D space, to aid in understanding their properties.
2. **Spacetime Diagrams and Simulations**: Create modules that allow users to simulate and visualize the effects of massive bodies on spacetime, like black hole warping.
3. **Interactive Learning Modules**: Interactive tutorials or problems that guide users through complex concepts using your toolkit.
4. **Symbolic Computation**: Incorporate symbolic computation for tensor algebra, making it easier for users to perform calculations without numerical values.
5. **GR in Different Coordinate Systems**: Allow users to convert tensors between different coordinate systems, like from Cartesian to spherical coordinates.
6. **Numerical Solvers for Einstein's Field Equations**: Implement or integrate solvers that can numerically solve Einstein's field equations under different conditions.
7. **Integration with Astrophysical Data**: Provide functionality to import and use real astrophysical data (like from LIGO or other observatories) for analysis with your package.
8. **Community Contributions**: Create a platform or system where users can contribute their own solutions or modules, fostering a community around your package.
9. **Performance Optimization Tools**: Tools for users to optimize their calculations, particularly for complex simulations.
10. **Quantum Gravity Extensions**: Although speculative, modules exploring the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity could be fascinating.

### General Suggestions
- **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and real-world examples are vital for educational tools. This includes both simple introductory examples and more complex case studies.
- **Modular Design**: Ensure that the package is modular so users can easily use only the parts they need.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Implement a system for receiving user feedback to continuously improve the package based on actual user experience and needs.

Your package has the potential to be a valuable tool in the field of theoretical physics, particularly for those new to GR. Balancing technical depth with accessibility will be key to its success.
